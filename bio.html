        <p>I've spent my formative years in Colorado, having moved here in middles school. I've attended several major universities heres. Starting undergrad at University of Colorado I found that the environment wasn't for me. After attending for 2 years I transferred to Colorado State University to finish my degree in Economics. Not long after graduation the economy hit the toilet and I figured it's be a good time to continue my education. I was accepted into Metropolitan State College of Denver to pursue an Accounting degree. This lead me to my first adult job at a software company, which I stayed at for 8 years. Recently I began work as a real Accountant and am hoping this course will only enhance my career.</p>
